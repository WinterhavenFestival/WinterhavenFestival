Winterhaven Festival of Lights 2025  Sponsor the Magic. Power the Mission.
The Winterhaven Festival of Lights isn’t just a beloved Tucson holiday tradition—it’s a volunteer-run, nonprofit-powered movement that transforms one neighborhood’s spirit into a season-long beacon of joy, generosity, and connection. For more than 75 years, Winterhaven has brought together generations of Southern Arizonans, not only to celebrate the magic of the holidays, but to make a real impact—from collecting over 37,000 pounds of food for the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona each year, to creating safe, inclusive experiences for hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors alike.
As a sponsor, you’re not just supporting lights—you’re illuminating lives. Your partnership helps fund critical infrastructure improvements, enhances accessibility and safety, uplifts our all-volunteer operations, and ensures our giving initiatives reach even more families in need. Together, we can preserve what makes Winterhaven magical while building a brighter, more connected future for our region.
Join us. Let your brand shine with purpose.
